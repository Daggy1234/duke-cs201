## What is computer Science?

- A systematic study
- Interdisciplinary
- Algorithims are everywhere
- Everyone can do computer Science, pairs well with stuff

## What are algorithms

- precise sequence of unambious steps that effectively compute an output given an input
- Intuitive English --> Precise English --> Pseudocode --> Software
- Code: algorithim is written in formal syntax so it can be run

## Data Structures

- organise data algorithim operating on
- Efficiently access
-
